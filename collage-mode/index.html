				<p><em>I was twenty-two and</em> explores identity and memory by weaving and collaging a series of panoramic images of queer spaces in New York City and the memories held within them. All locations at which an image was made were selected from Queering the Map <a href="https://queeringthemap.com/" target="blank">&#10132;</a>, a mapping project and a community-generated archive of queer memories and histories, initiated by the artist and designer Lucas Larochelle <a href="https://lucaslarochelle.com/" target="blank">&#10132;</a>.</p>
				
				<p>All images were captured using the iPhone camera app’s panorama feature, creating distinct distortions on each image, which as a collection, is unified by their elongated horizontal scale. The panorama technique was used for both pragmatic and conceptual purposes. Since the locations marked in the archive were not directly navigable and not always precise, panoramas allowed a greater margin of error for me to more accurately represent the space I wanted to capture. At the same time, the wideness of a panoramic image is literally all encompassing, which echoes with Larochelle’s project in that it tries to expand the definition of what a queer space is and looks like. A panoramic image can capture more than what the eyes can see at any given moment.</p>

				<p>My own ghost, in the forms of reflections and/or shadows, are always present, however visible to the eye, in each image. I impose myself in the spaces of others’ memories, in hopes of being able to experience them. The distortions in these images are also traces of my movement through space as I held and moved with the camera, which intensifies my presence in each capture. My aim through taking these images, afterall, was to make sense of my own queerness by experiencing and immersing myself in the queer memories of others, with hopes that my own memory would begin to emerge.</p>

				<p>This desire to compose my own queer memory in order to make sense of my identity grew stronger as I begin the process of compiling these images. In an intuitive manner, I extracted words and phrases from these memories and collaged them into sentences to fabricate a new queer memory, one that belongs to myself. This collaged memory then determined the sequencing of the images and their original corresponding memories, in which the extracted phrase of the first memory in the sequence, <em>I was twenty-two and</em>, became the title of this work.</p>

				<p>The publications, both in the forms of a book and a website, are designed to encourage exploration, as one would explore a city. Therefore, the book, consisting of 244 pages, is designed without page numbers to activate a reading/viewing experience that is non-linear and explorative, while tapping or hovering anywhere on the website reveals memories in the collection. Moreover, the first page of the book is simultaneously the cover and the first memory in the sequence, adding a sense of immediacy in experiencing the book. The 5.25 in by 4 in. book is bound using the slot-and-tab technique, which allows the book to be easily unbound, giving the reader/viewer the ability to break away from the prescribed narrative, and an opportunity to discover, weave, and collage their own desired one. This tactile experience of moving pages around and restitching a narrative together is mimicked in the collage mode of the website, where the reader/viewer can interact by highlighting any textual content and rearranging their sequence through the gestures of dragging and dropping in order to compose their own memory. Lastly, there are transitioning moments in both the book and the website where my version of the collaged memory is revealed in its entirety. Within the book, directional signs containing the collaged memory before and after certain points are evenly distributed throughout the book as inserts that intersect with the images. Whereas on the website, moments such as hovering over a link to another tab or the scrollbar reveal to its reader/viewer my collaged memory in its entirety.</p>

				<p>All images were taken between September and October 2019.</p>

				This was my first lesbian bar -- my first queer bar of any kind. <mark>I was twenty-two and</mark> had just moved to new york and it was the year I would meet my first real girlfriend. Nearly seven years later I find the place is still the same. I live in another city but am staying with a friend, one of my queer chosen family, for the weekend. We sit in the back with our drinks and watch a throuple of (maybe teenage) baby dykes making out in matching backwards hats. They pick up a fourth at the bar. In front of us a group of older soft butches starts dancing and goofing around with some younger folks who have been dancing for what seems like hours. Everything is wonderful.

				We'd only been dating for six weeks when it came time for Halloween, 2017.

We took over the bathroom in my dorm room and I made up your face, and when you looked at yourself in the mirror for the first time, visibly tangibly femme, you absolutely glowed with such joy. It's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. We held hands the whole night, dressing up as goth twins, and I'm so glad I got to share that night with you, the first time you publicly presented femme. Our relationship didn't end well, but <mark>I hope that you think of that night fondly, because I do</mark>.

We were teenagers and thought we were super deep, and had a lot of intense conversations and I cried on her--my first time crying on one of my friends like that--and it all felt very deep and meaningful and transcendent. It was probably the night that kicked off my slow realization that I was in love with her. (She turned out to be kind of a jerk, but hey, I made it out of the closet and now am now having a gay ol' time, so meh!)

Beginning to develop an obsession with Ruby Rose, getting irrationally excited about the rainbow flags hanging out of every window, the life-sized chocolate statue of two brides in the window of Li-Lac Chocolates... you know the drill. Anyway, June 26, around 10:30 AM, everyone's phone buzzes. A 9-year-old kid stands on a chair and yells, "GAY MARRIAGE IS LEGAL IN ALL 50 STATES!!" And no kidding, EVERYONE started cheering. We were all between like 8 and 15 years old, and being so young and insecure about my identity it was so reaffirming to be in a room full of celebration and support when this landmark moment happened. I've never felt more at the heart of history than in this exact second.
